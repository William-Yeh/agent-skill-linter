# ADR-0001: Isolate skill files in a `skill/` subdirectory

Date: 2026-04-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

`npx skills add <owner>/<repo>` (vercel-labs/skills) installs skill files by
locating SKILL.md in the repository and copying its containing directory. There
is no `.skillsignore` or equivalent configuration mechanism — exclusions are
hardcoded to dotfiles, `.git`, `__pycache__`, and `metadata.json`.

When SKILL.md lived at the repo root, `npx skills add` would copy the entire
repository — including `src/`, `tests/`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and
other artifacts that agents have no use for. This bloated the installed skill
and triggered Rule 17 (skill isolation) on the linter's own skill.

## Decision

Move `SKILL.md`, `references/`, and all Python source into the `skill/`
subdirectory. Tests and the dev-only `pyproject.toml` remain at the repo root.

`npx skills add William-Yeh/agent-skill-linter` now installs only `skill/`,
which contains everything an agent needs: the triage workflow, references, and
the executable linter scripts.

The installed layout inside `skill/` is:

```
skill/
├── SKILL.md
├── scripts/
│   ├── skill-lint.py   ← PEP 723 entry point (deps declared inline)
│   ├── linter.py
│   ├── rules.py
│   ├── fixers.py
│   └── models.py
└── references/
    ├── fix-templates.md
    └── semantic-rules.md
```

`skill-lint.py` uses PEP 723 inline script metadata so `uv run` resolves
dependencies without a separate `pyproject.toml` in `skill/`. See ADR-0003.

The linter rules were updated to support this layout:
- A `_repo_root()` helper climbs one level when the skill directory is a direct
  subdirectory of a `.git`-bearing parent.
- A `_repo_path(skill_dir, name)` helper resolves repo-level artifacts
  (LICENSE, README, `.github/`) by checking `skill_dir` first, then the repo
  root — allowing rules 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 to work correctly when linting
  subdir skills.
- `check_spec_compliance` skips the `skills_ref` directory-name check for
  subdir skills (the installed directory name comes from SKILL.md `name`, not
  the source path).

## Consequences

- Agents installing via `npx skills add` receive a self-contained install:
  SKILL.md, references, and executable Python scripts in one directory.
- The linter can lint both repo-root skills (legacy) and subdir skills (this
  layout) without configuration.
- Manual installation instructions in README must specify the target directory
  name explicitly (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/agent-skill-linter/`) rather than
  the generic skills folder.
- `_repo_root` walks upward through all parents until it finds a `.git` entry,
  supporting arbitrarily nested skill directories (e.g. monorepos, plugin trees).
  Test fixture contamination is prevented differently: fixture directories that
  need an isolated repo root include a plain `.gitroot` file. Git cannot track
  files named `.git` inside subdirectories, so `.gitroot` is used as the marker
  instead. `_repo_root()` recognises both `.git` and `.gitroot` as root signals.
- The root `pyproject.toml` is dev-only (pytest, ruff) with no package
  definition. Runtime dependencies are declared in `skill-lint.py` via PEP 723.
